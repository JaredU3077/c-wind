```cpp
// main.cpp - Clean entry point
int main(void) {
    // Initialize raylib and camera
    InitWindow(1920, 1080, "Browserwind");
    Camera3D camera = {/* camera setup */};

    // Initialize game state
    GameState state;

    // Initialize environmental systems
    EnvironmentManager environment;
    initializeWorld(environment);

    // Initialize gameplay systems
    initCombat();

    // Main game loop with modular updates
    while (!shouldClose) {
        handleTesting(camera, environment, state);
        handleInteractions(camera, environment, state, currentTime);
        updatePlayer(camera, state, environment, deltaTime);
        renderScene(camera, environment, state);
    }
}
```

#### Environmental Object Architecture
```cpp
// Polymorphic environmental objects
class EnvironmentalObject {
public:
    virtual void render() = 0;
    virtual CollisionBounds getCollisionBounds() const = 0;
    virtual bool isInteractive() const { return false; }
    virtual std::string getName() const { return "Object"; }
};

// Concrete implementations
class Building : public EnvironmentalObject {
    void render() override { /* building rendering */ }
    CollisionBounds getCollisionBounds() const override { /* AABB */ }
    bool isInteractive() const override { return canEnter; }
};

class Well : public EnvironmentalObject {
    void render() override { /* well rendering */ }
    CollisionBounds getCollisionBounds() const override { /* cylinder */ }
};
```

### Rendering Pipeline

The rendering system is modular and extensible:

1. **Scene Setup**: Camera positioning and viewport configuration
2. **Environmental Rendering**: All environmental objects rendered through unified interface
3. **Building Interiors**: Dynamic interior rendering when player enters buildings
4. **NPC Rendering**: Location-based NPC visibility and interaction indicators
5. **UI Overlay**: Real-time testing panel, interaction prompts, and game statistics
6. **Debug Visualization**: Collision bounds, performance metrics, and development tools

### Physics & Collision System

#### Universal Collision Detection
```cpp
class CollisionSystem {
public:
    static bool checkCollision(const CollisionBounds& bounds1, const CollisionBounds& bounds2) {
        switch (bounds1.shape) {
            case CollisionShape::BOX: return checkBoxCollision(bounds1, bounds2);
            case CollisionShape::SPHERE: return checkSphereCollision(bounds1, bounds2);
            case CollisionShape::CYLINDER: return checkCylinderCollision(bounds1, bounds2);
            case CollisionShape::CAPSULE: return checkCapsuleCollision(bounds1, bounds2);
        }
    }
};
```

#### Advanced Collision Resolution
- **Capsule-based Player Collision**: Accurate character collision using capsule shapes

- **Environmental Object Collision**: Trees, wells, and decorative objects prevent clipping
- **Building Interior Collision**: Proper collision detection inside buildings with wall constraints

### State Management Architecture

#### Centralized Game State
```cpp
struct GameState {
    // Clean separation of concerns
    bool isInDialog, isInBuilding;     // Location state
    float playerY, jumpVelocity;       // Physics state
    int swingsPerformed, score;        // Statistics
    bool testMouseCaptured, testWASDMovement; // Testing state
};
```

#### Real-time Testing Integration
- **Visual Testing Panel**: Live feature validation with color-coded status

- **Headers**: Include guards using `#ifndef` pattern
- **Naming**:
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (GameState, CollisionSystem)
  - Functions: `camelCase` (updatePlayer, checkCollision)
  - Variables: `camelCase` (playerPosition, cameraAngle)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (MAX_SWINGS, GRAVITY_FORCE)
  - Private members: `underscore_prefix` (_playerHealth, _cameraMatrix)

#### Bracing Style
```cpp
// Allman (BSD) style - REQUIRED
if (condition)
{
    // Code here
}
else if (anotherCondition)
{
    // Alternative code
}
else
{
    // Final alternative
}
```

#### Memory Management
- **Smart Pointers**: Always use `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`
- **RAII Pattern**: Resource management through constructors/destructors
- **No Raw Pointers**: Avoid raw `new`/`delete` in game logic
- **Factory Pattern**: Use factory functions for object creation

### Architecture Patterns

#### Component-Based Design
```cpp
// Environmental objects follow component pattern
class EnvironmentalObject {
public:
    virtual void render() = 0;                    // RenderComponent
    virtual CollisionBounds getCollisionBounds() const = 0; // PhysicsComponent
    virtual bool isInteractive() const { return false; }   // InteractableComponent
    virtual std::string getName() const { return "Object"; } // IdentityComponent

    Vector3 position;    // TransformComponent
    bool collidable = true; // PhysicsComponent
};
```

#### System Separation
